## About the Author

My name is Mike Zornek ([Blog](https://mikezornek.com) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zorn)). I am a self-employed developer and teacher who has been working with Elixir since 2017. 

The ElixirFocus project is an outlet for me to explore teaching opportunities within the Elixir ecosystem I've come to love.

I love meeting others who share my interest in Elixir and the BEAM. Please reach out and say hello. I'd love to hear what you are working on or interested in learning.
