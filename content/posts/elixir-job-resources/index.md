The following is a collection of resources and suggestions for people looking to acquire full time or project specific employment writing Elixir.

## Elixir Job Listings

First we have the aptly named [elixirjobs.net](https://elixirjobs.net/), which provides an active catalog of known job listings. 

I'd also highly recommend the `#jobs`, `#jobs_chat`, and `#looking_for_contract` rooms of the official [Elixir Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/elixir-lang/shared_invite/zt-eivteker-k_nArD59XHjjN_r8qeH6dw)

Elixir Radar which may be more well known for its weekly newsletter also hosts [a job board](https://elixir-radar.com/jobs), which is usually promoted in said emails.

The Elixir Forum has a dedicated [jobs tag](https://elixirforum.com/c/community/elixir-jobs/16) that is less active then the above can still be considered.

## Don't Let "Requirements" Scare You Away

One of my first web development jobs was with a company that at the time was looking for full time / X years experience. I applied despite my limited experience and with only part time availability (I was still in college at the time). They hired me anyways, found a project that I could contribute to and ultimately provided a great environment to improve my skills. 

The point is, many of these job descriptions do not fully convey the situation at these companies. If there is a opportunity that interests you, put yourself out there, introduce yourself and what you are looking for and apply. You never know how it might turn out.

## Elixir Meetups / Personal Networking

While applying to a specific job listing can be the most direct approach to finding a new gig, there is something to be said for personal networking as well. Many [Elixir meetups](https://www.meetup.com/topics/elixir/) and [communities](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/wiki) are very approachable online right now. Get out there, introduce yourself (maybe even do a talk!) and be shamelessly direct explaining that you are looking for new work opportunities. Be like [Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0-W4Sozr4I).

## Elixir Companies 

If you observe a company sponsoring an [Elixir conference](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/wiki/Conferences) or other kind of [Elixir event](https://erlef.org/events/), they are most likely looking to hire people. You don't even need to limit your search to current events; if that company sponsored an Elixir event years ago they are still a good target to contact. 

You can also look for [companies that have been promoted for their Elixir usage](https://elixir-lang.org/cases.html) or are otherwise [known to be using Elixir](https://elixir-companies.com/en). If you spot a company that might be a good fit, reach out to them -- even if they don't have a job listing.

## Self Promotion 

If you have even a mildly active personal website or social media account, consider adding a static header or profile link to a blog post explaining what kind of job you are looking for. Rename yourself on Twitter or Slack to "Billy Beta is looking for Elixir work" to make it clear, even in unrelated posts that you are available for hire and looking.

If you need to be more stealthy, consider a few private emails to friends explaining your situation and that you are looking for something new. So much of my own works comes from friends of friends. It is very helpful to have wide-social nets to allow for good things to happen.

## Be Prepared

Finally, be prepared. [Know what you want and don't want.](https://thewebivore.com/mnam-a-method-for-defining-your-next-role/) Write it all down and prioritize your interview questions to align with those needs. I personally am very behind the [People-first Business](https://wildbit.com/people-first/business) movement, see also the [People-first Job Board](https://peoplefirstjobs.com/), and so I align my own questions around those concerns.

Your ability to land an Elixir gig has never been better. Get out there and find something that is a good fit for you.
